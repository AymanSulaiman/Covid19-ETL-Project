By Toshe Ayo-Ariyo, Joshua Liu, Sanaz Shahbazian, Danielle Ho, and Ayman Sulaiman

## Project Proposal
Based upon the data compiled by John Hopkins University, we want to explore ''' Insert reasons here'''
This will be done by extracting the CSV data and migrating it to a PostgreSQL Database.  

## Project Description
We found data from `data.data.org` that had been compiled from John Hopkins University.  We filtered the data for March 2020 and evaluated the number of cases with respect to the deaths, recovery, and the confirmed cases.  

## Finding Data
All of the data that we used were from `https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases` where they compiled by the John Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) from various sources that include the World Health Organisations, Hong Kong Department of Health, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, etc.  This data is always being updated so we are narrowing the scope to the month of March.
